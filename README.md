# Inverter-based FLC of BLDC's Speed

## Description
This project designs and simulates a Fuzzy Logic Controller (FLC) to regulate the speed of a four pole-pair, three-phase BLDC motor. The model is implemented in MATLAB Simulink, where the rotor position is measured and used to determine the commutation sequence. The FLC adjusts the PWM duty cycle based on the speed error, providing smooth and robust motor speed control.

## Key aspects
- Simulated and implemented FLC in MATLAB/Simulink for precise speed regulation of a BLDC motor.
